# Steps
- For windows download [DU here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/du) 
- Unzip and open command prompt in the same directory as the folder (I think this is globally available in linux machines)

## Commands

du
 - `-c` for command separated list
 - `-l [number]` recursive function to how many layers deep to search
 - `c:\ > filename.csv` to get for your "C" drive and save the file as a CSV file
